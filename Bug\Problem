Hey, I hope this is correctly placed here as i cant find anywhere else to ask:
I recently installed Thaumcraft 5.2.4 on Minecraft 1.8.9, but it seems I can't scan anything with the Thaumometer. 
All it says is that "Nothing can be learned from this", but i instantly get "practical knowledge" of all aspects the item/block normally has.
So i get the page in my Thaumonomicon with the "recipe" of the aspect, but i can't gain any research points in any way.
Was the system of researching changed? Because as I read the Thaumonomicon, it's all like it used to be back on Minecraft 1.7.10 (Thaumcraft 3 i think).
Also, Steve doesn't look THROUGH the taumonomicon anymore but just holds it on his side like any item. Is this normal?
